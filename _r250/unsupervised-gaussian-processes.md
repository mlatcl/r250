\subsection{Gaussian Variables and Linear Dimensionality Reduction}

\slides{* Return to non-linear shortly.
* Now: Linear dimensionality reduction.
* First: Review Gaussian density properties.}

\notes{We will return to non-linear dimensionality reduction approaches shortly, but first we're going to consider *linear* approaches to dimensionality reduction. To do so, we'll first review some characteristics of the Gaussian density.}
