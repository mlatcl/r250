    "(Hotelling, 1933). Hotelling’s inspiration was to provide mathematical\n",
    "foundation for factor analysis methods that were by then widely used\n",
    "within psychology and the social sciences. His model was a factor\n",

    "\\mathbf{ y}_{i, :} \\sim \\lim_{\\sigma^2 \\rightarrow 0} \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top + \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}\\right).\n",
    "$$ The paper had two unfortunate effects. Firstly, the resulting model\n",
    "is no longer valid probablistically, because the covariance of this\n",
    "Gaussian is ‘degenerate’. Because $\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top$ has rank\n",
    "of at most $q$ where $q<p$ (due to the dimensionality reduction) the\n",
    "determinant of the covariance is zero, meaning the inverse doesn’t exist\n",
    "so the density, $$\n",

    "$$ is *not* valid for $q<p$ (where $\\mathbf{W}\\in \\Re^{p\\times q}$).\n",
    "This mathematical consequence is a probability density which has no\n",
    "‘support’ in large regions of the space for $\\mathbf{ y}_{i, :}$. There\n",
    "are regions for which the probability of $\\mathbf{ y}_{i, :}$ is zero.\n",
    "These are any regions that lie off the hyperplane defined by mapping\n",
    "from $\\mathbf{ z}$ to $\\mathbf{ y}$ with the matrix $\\mathbf{W}$. In\n",
    "factor analysis the noise corruption, $\\boldsymbol{ \\epsilon}$, allows\n",
    "for points to be found away from the hyperplane. In Hotelling’s PCA the\n",
    "noise variance is zero, so there is only support for points that fall\n",
    "precisely on the hyperplane. Secondly, Hotelling explicity chose to\n",
    "rename factor analysis as principal component analysis, arguing that the\n",
    "factors social scientist sought were different in nature to the concept\n",
    "of a mathematical factor. This was unfortunate because the factor\n",
    "loadings, $\\mathbf{W}$ can also be seen as factors in the mathematical\n",

    "as well as a factor loading.\n",

    "However, the paper had one great advantage over standard approaches to\n",
    "factor analysis. Despite the fact that the model was a special case that\n",
    "is subsumed by the more general approach of factor analysis it is this\n",
    "special case that leads to a particular algorithm, namely that the\n",
    "factor loadings (or principal components as Hotelling referred to them)\n",
    "are given by an *eigenvalue decomposition* of the empirical covariance\n",
